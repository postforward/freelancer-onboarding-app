-- üîÑ COMPLETE DATABASE RESET AND FRESH SETUP
-- This script will completely reset the database and set up fresh seed data

-- üö® STEP 1: CLEAR ALL EXISTING DATA
-- ==============================================================================

-- Temporarily disable RLS to allow deletion

-- Re-enable RLS
