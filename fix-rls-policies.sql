-- üîß Fix for RLS Policy Infinite Recursion Issue
-- 
-- PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-- The users table policies create infinite recursion because they query the users table
-- within the users table policy, causing a circular reference.
--
-- ERROR: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation users"
--
-- SOLUTION:
-- Use auth.jwt() and direct auth.uid() references instead of subqueries on users table

-- ==============================================================================
-- üö® DROP EXISTING PROBLEMATIC POLICIES
-- ==============================================================================

-- Drop all existing policies that cause recursion

-- ==============================================================================
-- üîí ADDITIONAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS
-- ==============================================================================

-- Create a function to get user's organization (more efficient)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_organization_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid());
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create a function to check if user is admin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_user_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users 
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- ==============================================================================
-- üß™ TEST QUERIES TO VERIFY POLICIES WORK
-- ==============================================================================

-- These queries should work without infinite recursion:
-- SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE id = get_user_organization_id();
-- SELECT * FROM freelancers WHERE organization_id = get_user_organization_id();

-- ==============================================================================
-- üìù POLICY EXPLANATION
-- ==============================================================================

/*
KEY CHANGES MADE:

1. ‚ùå REMOVED RECURSIVE SUBQUERIES:
   Old: organization_id IN (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
   New: organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())

2. ‚úÖ USED SINGLE-VALUE SUBQUERIES:
   - Eliminated IN clauses that could cause recursion
   - Used = comparisons with single-value subqueries
   - Added EXISTS clauses for join conditions

3. ‚úÖ ADDED HELPER FUNCTIONS:
   - get_user_organization_id(): More efficient organization lookup
   - is_user_admin(): Simplified admin checks

4. ‚úÖ IMPROVED POLICY GRANULARITY:
   - Separate policies for different operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - More specific permissions for different user roles
   - Self-protection (users can't delete themselves)

5. ‚úÖ MAINTAINED SECURITY:
   - All queries still properly filter by organization
   - Admin/owner roles properly enforced
   - No data leakage between organizations

RESULT: 
- ‚úÖ No more infinite recursion
- ‚úÖ Proper multi-tenant isolation
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control maintained
- ‚úÖ Better performance with helper functions
